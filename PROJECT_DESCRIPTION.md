# Project Description

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for **Koushik Grandhi's personal portfolio website** published via GitHub Pages. The site presents a professional profile, including background information, work experience, education, project highlights, interests, and links to social profiles.

## Purpose
The project serves as an online resume and portfolio to showcase:
- Professional experience in software engineering.
- Academic background.
- Curated project work across machine learning, Python, and data analytics.
- Public links for networking and contact.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** for page structure and content.
- **CSS** for visual styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** for interactive behavior.
- **Font Awesome** and **Google Fonts** for icons and typography.

## Repository Structure
- `index.html` — main single-page portfolio content.
- `css/styles.css` — site styling.
- `js/scripts.js` — client-side interactions.
- `assets/` — profile image and supporting static files.

## Notes
This is a lightweight static website, so no backend service or build pipeline is required for basic updates. Content and styling changes can be made directly in the source files.
